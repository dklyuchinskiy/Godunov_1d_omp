# Godunov_1d_omp
The parallel OpenMP implementation of linearized Godunov scheme (2017) for one-dimensional equations of fluid dynamics. The solution of few model problems, including Riemann problem, is presented.


The one-dimensional Godunov scheme of the first order for the equations of fluid dynamics
has been implemented via using OpenMP technology for multi-threading.

The two versions of the scheme are enabled: with nonlinear (1959) and linear (2018) solution of the Riemann problem on the boundaries.
The user can switch them in the code by itself (see definitions.h)

For better performance, please compile the code with Intel Compiler:

icc -ipo -O2 -qopenmp -o a.out main.cpp functions.cpp iteration.cpp gnuplot.cpp arrays.cpp

Run the appilcation as

./a.out

Before running, set the number (n) of OpenMP threads with command:

set OMP_NUM_THREADS=n (for Windows)

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=n (for Linux)

This application generates output files and print the results with GNUPLOT application (if respective #define was turn on)
But the output directory must have a special structure of folders. Please, see gnuplot.cpp for the further information.
